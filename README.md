# Visual Case Spy

Visual Case Spy is a desktop, offline, and visual OSINT investigation tool built in Python. It's focused on maximum usability and graphical power, designed for analysts to generate, connect, and visualize case data, entities, and their relationships.

## Current Status

This project is currently in the **early development (pre-alpha)** phase.

## Core Ideas

*   Offline-first for privacy and control.
*   Intuitive nodal interface for visual analysis.
*   Focus on clean UX and smooth performance.
*   OSINT Starter Kit with predefined nodes and workflows.

## Technologies (Planned)

*   Python 3.10+
*   PySide6 (for the GUI)
*   SQLite (for project data storage)
*   NodeGraphQt (being evaluated) or custom QGraphicsView implementation
